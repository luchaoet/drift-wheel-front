      "value": "Bolt pattern is one of the most important data for the wheel fitment. When you install a wheel on a car, the first thing you have to check the wheel P.C.D.. Different car has different P.C.D., a Mercedes-Benz usually is in P.C.D. 5-100 while BMW is 5-120, but this is not fixed. Mercedes G550 is an exception, it is in P.C.D. 5-130. Land rover freelander is 5-114.3, ranger rover is 5-120, evoque is 5-108 and defender is 5-165.1. So when purchasing wheels, be carefull about the bolt patterns."
